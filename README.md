# spark_k_distance_join_query
The subject of this project is named: Scalable Distance Joins for Point Data. This problem of distance join is described as follows: 
Given two datasets A and B which describes as these columns: (ID,x,y), find the pairs (a,b) that a is involved in A and b is involved in B and satisfy the condition: d(a,b) =< θ that θ is a parameter given by the user. Notice that the data is huge. Specifically 10.000 points in dataset A and 10.000 points in dataset B, as well.
